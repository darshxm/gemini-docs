**Important:** Gemini 3 model APIs now generate a unique `id` for every function call. If you are manually constructing the conversation history or using the REST API, when returning the result of your executed function to the model we recommend passing the matching `id` in your `functionResponse`. If you are using the standard Python or Node.js SDKs, this is handled automatically.

Function calling lets you connect models to external tools and APIs.
Instead of generating text responses, the model determines when to call specific
functions and provides the necessary parameters to execute real-world actions.
This allows the model to act as a bridge between natural language and real-world
actions and data. Function calling has 3 primary use cases:

- [**Take Actions:**](#meeting) Interact with external systems using APIs, such as scheduling appointments, creating invoices, sending emails, or controlling smart home devices.
- [**Augment Knowledge:**](#weather) Access information from external sources like databases, APIs, and knowledge bases.
- [**Extend Capabilities:**](#chart) Use external tools to perform computations and extend the limitations of the model, such as using a calculator or creating charts.

You can browse examples of these use cases below:

### Schedule Meeting

This example shows how to define a function that schedules a meeting with attendees at a specific time, allowing the model to parse user requests and return structured arguments to trigger actions in external systems.

### Get Weather

This example shows how to define a function that retrieves temperature data for a location, enabling the model to call external APIs to answer queries requiring real-time or external information.

### Create Chart

This example shows how to define a function that generates a bar chart from structured data, demonstrating how the model can use external tools to perform computations or create visual assets:

## How function calling works

Function calling involves a structured interaction between your application, the
model, and external functions. Here's a breakdown of the process:

This process can be repeated over multiple turns, allowing for complex
interactions and workflows. The model also supports calling multiple functions
in a single turn ([parallel function calling](#parallel_function_calling)), in
sequence ([compositional function calling](#compositional_function_calling)),
and with built-in Gemini tools ([multi-tool use](#native-tools)).

* **Always map function IDs:** Gemini 3 now always returns a unique
`id` with every `functionCall`. Include this exact `id` in your
`functionResponse` so the model can accurately map your result back to the
original request.

### Step 1: Define a function declaration

Define a function and its declaration within your application code that allows
users to set light values and make an API request. This function could call
external services or APIs.

### Step 2: Call the model with function declarations

Once you have defined your function declarations, you can prompt the model to
use them. It analyzes the prompt and function declarations and decides whether
to respond directly or to call a function. If a function is called, the response
object will contain a function call suggestion.

The model then returns a `functionCall` object in an OpenAPI compatible
schema specifying how to call one or more of the declared functions in order to
respond to the user's question.

### Step 3: Execute set_light_values function code

Extract the function call details from the model's response, parse the arguments
, and execute the `set_light_values` function.

### Step 4: Create user friendly response with function result and call the model again

Finally, send the result of the function execution back to the model so it can
incorporate this information into its final response to the user.

This completes the function calling flow. The model successfully used the
`set_light_values` function to perform the request action of the user.

## Function declarations

When you implement function calling in a prompt, you create a `tools` object,
which contains one or more `function declarations`. You define functions using
JSON, specifically with a [select subset](https://ai.google.dev/api/caching#Schema)
of the [OpenAPI schema](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#schemaw) format. A
single function declaration can include the following parameters:

- `name` (string): A unique name for the function (`get_weather_forecast`, `send_email`). Use descriptive names without spaces or special characters (use underscores or camelCase).
- `description` (string): A clear and detailed explanation of the function's purpose and capabilities. This is crucial for the model to understand when to use the function. Be specific and provide examples if helpful ("Finds theaters based on location and optionally movie title which is currently playing in theaters.").
- `parameters` (object): Defines the input parameters the function expects. `type` (string): Specifies the overall data type, such as `object`. `properties` (object): Lists individual parameters, each with: `type` (string): The data type of the parameter, such as `string`, `integer`, `boolean, array`. `description` (string): A description of the parameter's purpose and format. Provide examples and constraints ("The city and state, e.g., 'San Francisco, CA' or a zip code e.g., '95616'."). `enum` (array, optional): If the parameter values are from a fixed set, use "enum" to list the allowed values instead of just describing them in the description. This improves accuracy ("enum": ["daylight", "cool", "warm"]). `required` (array): An array of strings listing the parameter names that are mandatory for the function to operate.

You can also construct `FunctionDeclarations` from Python functions directly using
`types.FunctionDeclaration.from_callable(client=client, callable=your_function)`.

## Function calling with thinking models

Gemini 3 and 2.5 series models use an internal ["thinking"](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking) process to reason through requests. This
significantly improves function calling performance,
allowing the model to better determine when to call a function and which
parameters to use. Because the Gemini API is stateless, models use
[thought signatures](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thought-signatures) to maintain context
across multi-turn conversations.

This section covers advanced management of thought signatures and is only
necessary if you're manually constructing API requests (e.g., via REST) or
manipulating conversation history.

**If you're using the [Google GenAI SDKs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/libraries) (our
official libraries), you don't need to manage this process**. The SDKs
automatically handle the necessary steps, as shown in the earlier
[example](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#step-4).

### Managing conversation history manually

If you modify the conversation history manually, instead of sending the
[complete previous response](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#step-4) you
must correctly handle the `thought_signature` included in the model's turn.

Follow these rules to ensure the model's context is preserved:

- Always send the `thought_signature` back to the model inside its original [`Part`](https://ai.google.dev/api#request-body-structure).
- **Always include the exact `id` from the `function_call` in your `function_response` so the API can map the result to the correct request.**
- Don't merge a `Part` containing a signature with one that does not. This breaks the positional context of the thought.
- Don't combine two `Parts` that both contain signatures, as the signature strings cannot be merged.

In Gemini 3, any [`Part`](https://ai.google.dev/api#request-body-structure) of a model response
may contain a thought signature.
While we generally recommend returning signatures from all `Part` types,
passing back thought signatures is mandatory for function calling. Unless you
are manipulating conversation history manually, the Google GenAI SDK will
handle thought signatures automatically.

If you are manipulating conversation history manually, refer to the
[Thoughts Signatures](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thought-signatures) page for complete
guidance and details on handling thought signatures for Gemini 3.

While not necessary for implementation, you can inspect the response to see the
`thought_signature` for debugging or educational purposes.

Learn more about limitations and usage of thought signatures, and about thinking
models in general, on the [Thinking](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking#signatures) page.

## Parallel function calling

In addition to single turn function calling, you can also call multiple
functions at once. Parallel function calling lets you execute multiple functions
at once and is used when the functions are not dependent on each other. This is
useful in scenarios like gathering data from multiple independent sources, such
as retrieving customer details from different databases or checking inventory
levels across various warehouses or performing multiple actions such as
converting your apartment into a disco.

When the model initiates multiple function calls in a single turn, you don't
need to return the `function_result` objects in the same order that the
`function_call` objects were received. The Gemini API maps each result back to
its corresponding call using the `id` from the model's output. This lets you
execute your functions asynchronously and append the results to your list as
they complete.

Configure the function calling mode to allow using all of the specified tools.
To learn more, you can read about
[configuring function calling](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#function_calling_modes).

Each of the printed results reflects a single function call that the model has
requested. To send the results back, include the responses in the same order as
they were requested.

The Python SDK supports [automatic function calling](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#automatic_function_calling_python_only),
which automatically converts Python functions to declarations, handles the
function call execution and response cycle for you. Following is an example for
the disco use case.

**Note:** Automatic Function Calling is a Python SDK only feature at the moment.

## Compositional function calling

Compositional or sequential function calling allows Gemini to chain multiple
function calls together to fulfill a complex request. For example, to answer
"Get the temperature in my current location", the Gemini API might first invoke
a `get_current_location()` function followed by a `get_weather()` function that
takes the location as a parameter.

The following example demonstrates how to implement compositional function
calling using the Python SDK and automatic function calling.

Compositional function calling is a native [Live
API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) feature. This means Live API
can handle the function calling similar to the Python SDK.

## Function calling modes

The Gemini API lets you control how the model uses the provided tools
(function declarations). Specifically, you can set the mode within
the.`function_calling_config`.

- `VALIDATED`: Default mode for tool combination (when built-in tools or structured outputs also enabled). The model is constrained to predict either function calls or natural language, and ensures function schema adherence. If `allowed_function_names` is not provided, the model picks from all of the available function declarations. If `allowed_function_names` is provided, the model picks from the set of allowed functions. This mode reduces malformed function calls (compared to `AUTO` mode).
- `AUTO`: Default mode when only function_declarations tool enabled. The model decides whether to generate a natural language response or suggest a function call based on the prompt and context.
- `ANY`: The model is constrained to always predict a function call and ensures function schema adherence. If `allowed_function_names` is not specified, the model can choose from any of the provided function declarations. If `allowed_function_names` is provided as a list, the model can only choose from the functions in that list. Use this mode when you require a function call response to every prompt (if applicable).
- `NONE`: The model is prohibited from making function calls. This is equivalent to sending a request without any function declarations. Use this to temporarily disable function calling without removing your tool definitions.

## Automatic function calling (Python only)

When using the Python SDK, you can provide Python functions directly as tools.
The SDK converts these functions into declarations, manages the function call
execution, and handles the response cycle for you. Define your function with
type hints and a docstring. For optimal results, it is recommended to use
[Google-style docstrings.](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods)
The SDK will then automatically:

The SDK currently doesn't parse argument descriptions into the property
description slots of the generated function declaration. Instead, it sends the
entire docstring as the top-level function description.

You can disable automatic function calling with:

### Automatic function schema declaration

The API is able to describe any of the following types. `Pydantic` types are
allowed, as long as the fields defined on them are also composed of allowed
types. Dict types (like `dict[str: int]`) are not well supported here, don't
use them.

To see what the inferred schema looks like, you can convert it using
[`from_callable`](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/genai.html#genai.types.FunctionDeclaration.from_callable):

## Multi-tool use: Combine built-in tools with function calling

You can enable multiple tools, combining built-in tools with function calling in
the same request.

Gemini 3 models can combine built-in tools with function calling out-of-the-box,
thanks to the tool context circulation feature. Read the page on
[Combining built-in tools and function calling](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/tool-combination) to learn more.

**Preview:** Combining built-in tools with function calling and tool context circulation features are in Preview in Gemini 3 models.

For models before the Gemini 3 series, use the
[Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/tools).

## Multimodal function responses

**Note:** This feature is available for [Gemini 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3) series models.

For Gemini 3 series models, you can include multimodal content in
the function response parts that you send to the model. The model can process
this multimodal content in its next turn to produce a more informed response.
The following MIME types are supported for multimodal content in function
responses:

- **Images**: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`
- **Documents**: `application/pdf`, `text/plain`

To include multimodal data in a function response, include it as one or more
parts nested within the `functionResponse` part. Each multimodal part must
contain `inlineData`. If you reference a multimodal part from
within the structured `response` field, it must contain a unique `displayName`.

You can also reference a multimodal part from within the structured `response`
field of the `functionResponse` part by using the JSON reference format
`{"$ref": "<displayName>"}`. The model substitutes the reference with the
multimodal content when processing the response. Each `displayName` can only be
referenced once in the structured `response` field.

The following example shows a message containing a `functionResponse` for a
function named `get_image` and a nested part containing image data with
`displayName: "instrument.jpg"`. The `functionResponse`'s `response` field
references this image part:

## Function calling with Structured output

**Note:** This feature is available for [Gemini 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3) series models.

For Gemini 3 series models, you can use function calling with
[structured output](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output). This lets the model
predict function calls or outputs that adhere to a specific schema. As a result,
you receive consistently formatted responses when the model doesn't generate
function calls.

## Model context protocol (MCP)

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is
an open standard for connecting AI applications with external tools and data.
MCP provides a common protocol for models to access context, such as functions
(tools), data sources (resources), or predefined prompts.

The Gemini SDKs have built-in support for the MCP, reducing boilerplate code and
offering
[automatic tool calling](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#automatic_function_calling_python_only)
for MCP tools. When the model generates an MCP tool call, the Python and
JavaScript client SDK can automatically execute the MCP tool and send the
response back to the model in a subsequent request, continuing this loop until
no more tool calls are made by the model.

Here, you can find an example of how to use a local MCP server with Gemini and
`mcp` SDK.

### Limitations with built-in MCP support

Built-in MCP support is a [experimental](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#preview)
feature in our SDKs and has the following limitations:

- Only tools are supported, not resources nor prompts
- It is available for the Python and JavaScript/TypeScript SDK.
- Breaking changes might occur in future releases.

Manual integration of MCP servers is always an option if these limit what you're
building.

## Supported models

This section lists models and their function calling capabilities. Experimental
models are not included. You can find a comprehensive capabilities overview on
the [model overview](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) page.

## Best practices

- **Function and Parameter Descriptions:** Be extremely clear and specific in your descriptions. The model relies on these to choose the correct function and provide appropriate arguments.
- **Naming:** Use descriptive function names (without spaces, periods, or dashes).
- **Strong Typing:** Use specific types (integer, string, enum) for parameters to reduce errors. If a parameter has a limited set of valid values, use an enum.
- **Tool Selection:** While the model can use an arbitrary number of tools, providing too many can increase the risk of selecting an incorrect or suboptimal tool. For best results, aim to provide only the relevant tools for the context or task, ideally keeping the active set to a maximum of 10-20. Consider dynamic tool selection based on conversation context if you have a large total number of tools.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Provide context: Tell the model its role (e.g., "You are a helpful weather assistant."). Give instructions: Specify how and when to use functions (e.g., "Don't guess dates; always use a future date for forecasts."). Encourage clarification: Instruct the model to ask clarifying questions if needed. See [Agentic workflows](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies#agentic-workflows) for further strategies on designing these prompts. Here is an example of a tested [system instruction](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies#agentic-si-template).
- **Temperature:** Use a low temperature (e.g., 0) for more deterministic and reliable function calls. The `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` parameters control how the model generates responses. Although you can modify these parameters, we strongly recommend keeping them at their default values for Gemini 3.x models. Changing these parameters (for example, setting the temperature below 1.0) can cause unexpected behavior, such as looping or degraded performance, particularly in complex mathematical or reasoning tasks.
- **Validation:** If a function call has significant consequences (e.g., placing an order), validate the call with the user before executing it.
- **Check Finish Reason:** Always check the [`finishReason`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#FinishReason) in the model's response to handle cases where the model failed to generate a valid function call.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your functions to gracefully handle unexpected inputs or API failures. Return informative error messages that the model can use to generate helpful responses to the user.
- **Security:** Be mindful of security when calling external APIs. Use appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms. Avoid exposing sensitive data in function calls.
- **Token Limits:** Function descriptions and parameters count towards your input token limit. If you're hitting token limits, consider limiting the number of functions or the length of the descriptions, break down complex tasks into smaller, more focused function sets.
- **Mix of bash and custom tools** For those building with a mix of bash and custom tools, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview comes with a separate endpoint available via the API called [`gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools`](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini-3.1-pro-preview#gemini-31-pro-preview-customtools).

## Notes and limitations

- Positioning of function call parts: When using custom function declarations [alongside built-in tools](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/tool-combination) (like Google Search), the model may return a mix of `functionCall`, `toolCall`, and `toolResponse` parts in a single turn. Because of this, don't assume the `functionCall` will always be the last item in the parts array. If you are manually parsing the JSON response, always iterate through the parts array rather than relying on position.
- Only a [subset of the OpenAPI schema](https://ai.google.dev/api/caching#FunctionDeclaration) is supported.
- For `ANY` mode, the API may reject very large or deeply nested schemas. If you encounter errors, try simplifying your function parameter and response schemas by shortening property names, reducing nesting, or limiting the number of function declarations.
- Supported parameter types in Python are limited.
- Automatic function calling is a Python SDK feature only.
