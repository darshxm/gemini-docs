The Gemini API can generate text output from text, images, video, and audio
inputs.

Here's a basic example:

## Thinking with Gemini

Gemini models often have ["thinking"](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking) enabled by default
which allows the model to reason before responding to a request.

Each model supports different thinking configurations which gives you control
over cost, latency, and intelligence. For more details, see the
[thinking guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking#set-budget).

## System instructions and other configurations

You can guide the behavior of Gemini models with system instructions. To do so,
pass a [`GenerateContentConfig`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#v1beta.GenerationConfig)
object.

The [`GenerateContentConfig`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#v1beta.GenerationConfig)
object also lets you override default generation parameters, such as
[`max_output_tokens`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#v1beta.GenerationConfig).

The `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` parameters control how the model generates responses. Although you can modify these parameters, we strongly recommend keeping them at their default values for Gemini 3.x models. Changing these parameters (for example, setting the temperature below 1.0) can cause unexpected behavior, such as looping or degraded performance, particularly in complex mathematical or reasoning tasks.

Refer to the [`GenerateContentConfig`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#v1beta.GenerationConfig)
in our API reference for a complete list of configurable parameters and their
descriptions.

## Multimodal inputs

The Gemini API supports multimodal inputs, allowing you to combine text with
media files. The following example demonstrates providing an image:

For alternative methods of providing images and more advanced image processing,
see our [image understanding guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-understanding).
The API also supports [document](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/document-processing), [video](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video-understanding), and [audio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/audio)
inputs and understanding.

## Streaming responses

By default, the model returns a response only after the entire generation 
process is complete.

For more fluid interactions, use streaming to receive [`GenerateContentResponse`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#v1beta.GenerateContentResponse) instances incrementally
as they're generated.

## Multi-turn conversations (chat)

Our SDKs provide functionality to collect multiple rounds of prompts and
responses into a chat, giving you an easy way to keep track of the conversation
history.

**Note:** Chat functionality is only implemented as part of the SDKs. Behind the scenes, it still uses the [`generateContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#method:-models.generatecontent) API. For multi-turn conversations, the full conversation history is sent to the model with each follow-up turn.

Streaming can also be used for multi-turn conversations.
